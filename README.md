# Description 

This repository comprises a standard coding evaluation that incorporates both multiple-choice inquiries and engaging coding challenges.
The purpose behind its creation was to gain proficiency in such assessments by applying the competencies acquired through the completion of the JavaScript module.
The goal was to construct a time-limited coding quiz containing multiple-choice queries. 
This application functions within a web browser and showcases dynamically refreshed HTML and CSS driven by JavaScript code, resulting in a sleek, refined, and adaptable user interface.
The project contains  JavaScript, HTML, CSS, querySelector, innerHTML and web API.

## Instructions

Please utilize the provided link for accessing the challenge: https://najmamusa.github.io/codingquiz/. This will launch the application in your default web browser. 

Once the application has loaded, click on "Start Quiz" to initiate the quiz. The first question will be presented along with a list of four choices and a countdown timer set to 100 seconds. 

To proceed to the next question, select an answer from the provided choices. Choosing an incorrect answer will result in a deduction of 5 seconds from the remaining time, while a correct answer will have no impact on the timer.

The game concludes either when all questions have been answered or when the timer reaches 0. Following this, your score will be revealed, and you will have the option to save it along with adding your initials.
